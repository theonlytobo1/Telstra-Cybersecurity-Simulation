# Telstra-Cybersecurity-Simulation
A practical cybersecurity SOC simulation via Forage & Telstra. Malware triage, log analysis, firewall development in Python, and incident post-mortem.

# Telstra Cybersecurity Simulation ‚Äì Forage
This project is based on the **Telstra Cybersecurity Virtual Experience** offered by [Forage](https://www.theforage.com). It simulates the responsibilities of a **Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst** responding to a malware attack on enterprise infrastructure.

## üß† Project Summary

In this simulation, I took on the role of a SOC Analyst and performed the following tasks:
- ‚úÖ Triage and analysis of malware alerts
- ‚úÖ Investigated Spring4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965)
- ‚úÖ Firewall log pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ Python-based firewall rule implementation
- ‚úÖ Testing against malicious payloads
- ‚úÖ Drafting technical postmortem documentation
